## Common Issues

### Nuxt Chunk Loading Errors

**Problem:** Seeing errors in Google Search Console, Sentry, or browser console related to chunk loading failures.

These errors occur when users (or crawlers) try to load JavaScript chunks that no longer exist after a deployment.

**Common error messages:**

> "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'default')"

> "Couldn't resolve component 'default' at /"

> "undefined is not an object (evaluating 'r.default')"

> "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module"

> "Importing a module script failed"

**Why this happens:**

1. User loads your site and receives HTML + initial JavaScript
2. You deploy a new version with different chunk hashes
3. User navigates to a new page, triggering a dynamic import
4. The old chunk no longer exists (404), causing the error
5. Particularly affects Safari/iOS users and crawlers (Googlebot, Bingbot)

**Solution:**

Install and configure Nuxt Skew Protection to detect and handle version mismatches:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add nuxt-skew-protection
```

The module will:
- Detect when loaded chunks become invalid
- Notify users to refresh for the latest version
- Serve old chunks to sessions that need them
- Prevent crawler indexing errors

See [Installation](/docs/skew-protection/getting-started/installation) for setup instructions.

### Google Search Console 500 Errors

**Problem:** Google Search Console showing 500 errors for valid pages, particularly with error messages like:

> "Couldn't resolve component 'default' at [path]"

> "Server Error (500)"

**Why crawlers are affected:**

Googlebot and other crawlers often:
- Render pages with a delay (sometimes days after crawling)
- Download all assets first, then execute JavaScript later
- Hit your site between deployments
- Get HTML referencing chunks that no longer exist

**Solution:**

Nuxt Skew Protection specifically addresses crawler issues by providing long-lived build assets.

Make sure you have the module [installed](/docs/skew-protection/getting-started/installation) and configured [persistent storage](/docs/skew-protection/guides/storage-configuration) for production.
