## Why Nuxt Skew Protection?

Congrats on shipping that latest release! Unfortunately, many of your users
are going to be using the previous version of your app for hours to days
afterwards until they refresh.

Finally fixed that critical bug? Great, but users with the old version will
keep experiencing issues until they reload. Crawlers will often hit your site
and request build chunks that no longer exist, leading to 500 errors and
broken indexes.

You've just been **"skewed"**! Skew is the version difference between what
your users are running and what is currently deployed.

While Nuxt helps by hard-reloading on navigation when it detects a new
release, it's often not enough to ensure a smooth experience for all users
and crawlers. Just check out one of Nuxt's top commented
[issues](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues/29624).

Nuxt Skew Protection solves these problems by:

1. **Notifying users intelligently** when their loaded code becomes outdated
2. **Keeping old build assets accessible** so crawlers and old sessions don't
   break
3. **Providing real-time update detection** using polling, SSE, or WebSockets

::note
**Early Access (v0.x):** This module is currently MIT licensed for all projects. Once stable (v1+), it will be part of [Nuxt SEO Pro](https://nuxtseo.com/pricing) and require a commercial license. **You can always use v0.x versions without a license.**

## Features

### âš¡ Real-time Update Notifications

Zero-config notifications when a new version is deployed. Choose from three
strategies:

- **Polling** - Works everywhere, uses Nuxt's built-in mechanism
- **SSE** - Real-time Server-Sent Events for Node.js/Bun/Deno
- **WebSocket** - Real-time updates for Cloudflare Durable Objects

### ðŸŽ¯ Intelligent User Notifications

Avoid spamming users with update notifications. Only notify when their
**currently loaded modules** become invalidated by the new deployment.

Uses a service worker to track loaded JavaScript modules and intelligently
detect when they're deleted in new builds.

### ðŸ“¦ Long-lived Build Assets

Previous build assets remain accessible to avoid breaking:

- Search engine crawlers hitting old URLs
- Users on old sessions navigating your app
- Progressive web apps with cached routes

Assets are stored with smart deduplication to minimize storage costs.

### ðŸŽ¨ Headless UI Component

Ship it quicker with a headless `<SkewNotification>` component that works
perfectly with any UI framework:

```vue
<template>
  <SkewNotification v-slot="{ isCurrentChunksOutdated }">
    <div v-if="isCurrentChunksOutdated">
      New Update!
    </div>
  </SkewNotification>
</template>
```
