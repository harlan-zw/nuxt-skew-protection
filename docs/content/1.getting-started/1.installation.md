## Basic Configuration

Out of the box the module will provide minimal build chunks preservation and a [`checkForUpdateStrategy`](/docs/skew-protection/guides/update-strategies). To get the most out of the module
you should configure the following:

- [Notification Component](/docs/skew-protection/guides/immediate-updates): Notifies users when a new version is available and their chunks are outdated.
- [Persistance Storage](/docs/skew-protection/guides/storage-configuration): Ensures previous build manifests are stored and accessible for long-lived assets thresholds.

## Skew Cookie

To keep track of the versions, the module uses a cookie to store the user's current build version. This cookies name is
`__nkpv`, see [cookie options](/docs/skew-protection/api/config#cookie) for full details.

## Verifying Installation

Once you build and deploy the module you can check your Nuxt App Manifest file, it's locally at `/_nuxt/builds/latest.json`. Within
it you should find a manifest of previous builds within the configured [cache threshold](/docs/skew-protection/guides/storage-configuration#cache-threshold).
